  <p><strong>Brangäne</strong> in <em>Tristan und Isolde</em></p>
  <p>New Palace Opera</p>
  <br />
  <p>“Although Mae Heydorn’s mezzo is dark-hued and plangent, it is so wonderfully projected and reliable that I could imagine her singing Isolde one day. Her fine performance of Brangäne’s Watch (‘Einsam wachend in der Nacht’) and cries of ‘Habet Acht!’ were imbued with a deep foreboding which resonated throughout the church from the organ loft at the rear.”</p>

  <p>“Heydorn grabbed my attention as Mad Margaret – the timing of the line delivery as well as the visual comedy she brought to the role were just a few of Heydorn’s strengths in taking on the role”</p>

  <p><strong>Ruth</strong> in <em>The Pirates of Penzance</em></p>
  <p>National Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company</p>
  <br />
  <p>“...with very strong vocals the part of Ruth, performed by Mezzo Soprano Mae Heydorn complimented this production beautifully in many of the scenes with the pirates- her vocals demonstrated amplitude and precision and her voice assisted her characters performance greatly.”</p>

  <p><strong>Prinz Orlofsky</strong> in <em>Die Fledermaus</em></p>
  <p>Fulham Opera</p>
  <br />
  <p>“Heydorn’s sultry, lingering mezzo, complete with a sharply observed comic Russian accent, makes the free-spirited, ennui-ridden Prince both believable and lovable.”</p>
